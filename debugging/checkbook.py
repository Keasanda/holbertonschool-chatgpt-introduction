This Python code defines a class Checkbook that represents a simple checkbook. It allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The main function creates an instance of Checkbook and then enters a loop, prompting the user for actions until they choose to exit.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Checkbook Class:
__init__(self): Initializes the checkbook with a balance of 0.0.
deposit(self, amount): Deposits the specified amount into the checkbook, updating the balance.
withdraw(self, amount): Withdraws the specified amount from the checkbook, if sufficient funds are available.
get_balance(self): Prints the current balance of the checkbook.
main Function:
Creates an instance of Checkbook.
Enters a loop to interact with the checkbook:
Prompts the user for an action (deposit, withdraw, balance, exit).
Performs the corresponding action based on user input.
User Interaction:
User input is used to determine the action to be performed.
Floating-point numbers are used for deposit and withdrawal amounts.
The balance is formatted as a currency with two decimal places.
Error Handling:
If the user inputs an invalid command, a message is displayed, and the loop continues.
Overall, this code provides a basic framework for a simple checkbook program, allowing users to manage their balance interactively.
